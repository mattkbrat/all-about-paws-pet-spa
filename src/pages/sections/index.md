All About Paws Pet Spa LLC. is a locally owned business providing full-service
dog grooming.
My core belief is that every animal is unique and requires customized treatment.
While many pets come in with tails wagging in happy anticipation of being groomed,
others are more anxious.
For this reason, I always spend a few minutes "meeting" your pet and helping them
get to know me before I start grooming.

Kindness, understanding, knowledge, and experience are the keys to great grooming,
so I go out of my way to treat every animal with gentleness and respect -
the way I treat my own pets.

As I have 20 plus years in the professional grooming industry, you can rest
assured your beloved pet will be in good hands.
