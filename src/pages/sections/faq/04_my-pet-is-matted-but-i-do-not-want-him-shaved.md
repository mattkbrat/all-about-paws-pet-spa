Because it's painful! Matting is a very serious problem for dogs.
Mats left in a pet's coat only grow tighter and can damage the skin,
or even tear it open. Mats are often deceptive, hiding in areas that
don't get much visual attention from owners, such as under the belly,
under the tail, and in the "armpit" area.
If you are not on a regular brushing regimen with your dog,
you may be unaware of these "secret" mats. These mats can trap moisture,
urine and fecal matter tightly against the pet's skin, allowing mold, fungus,
or bacteria to grow, causing skin irritations that can be very uncomfortable
for your pet. A number of things causes matting. Improper brushing is one.
There is a right way and a wrong way to brush certain types of coats,
as well as the correct tools to use. When you bathe your pet at home,
no matter what product you use, if the hair is not completely combed out
before and after bathing, any mats or tangles can be worsened by the wet/dry process.
