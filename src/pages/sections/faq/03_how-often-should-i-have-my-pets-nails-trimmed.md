Your pet's nails should be trimmed at a minimum of every four weeks. Dogs that regularly walk on pavement tend to wear down on their own, and do not need to be trimmed as frequently. Long nails should be cut every 2-3 weeks to help wear down the quicks. Extra long nails have to be cut a little bit at a time and can NOT be cut short all at once.
