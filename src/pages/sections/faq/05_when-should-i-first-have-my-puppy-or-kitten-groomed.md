I would not accept a youngster for grooming prior to completion of initial vaccinations (usually about 15-16 weeks old). Initially, I would suggest the grooming be brief, trimming the hair around the eyes, paws, and anus only. The objective is to have the experience be a positive one at the outset, so your pet looks forward to each future grooming experience for a lifetime. Be unemotional when you drop him off and give him a lot of praise when you pick him so you do not telegraph anxiety at the outset and show pleasure at the end of the experience.
