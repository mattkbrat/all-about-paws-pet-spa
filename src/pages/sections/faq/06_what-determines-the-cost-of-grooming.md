The cost is based on the breed of the pet, what you want to be done, the condition of the coat, and the pet's behavior. All pets are different. As hard as you try to describe your pet, his hair, his behavior and what you want to be done over the phone, without seeing and meeting your pet, I cannot give you an exact price over the phone â€“ Only an approximation.
