Please notify me by telephone {import.meta.env.PHONE} at least 24 hours before your appointment time! I understand that occasionally something may prevent you from making your appointment, but notice is greatly appreciated so that another client may fill your appointment time. After one no-show a prepayment may be required for you to book another appointment.
