It depends on the breed, his lifestyle and on how you want him to look and smell. While it is true that a clean animal is a healthier one, excessive bathing can dry out the skin and strip it of its natural oils.

Generally speaking, short-coated dogs with no skin conditions can go six to eight weeks between baths unless they have gotten into something dirty or smelly. Longer coated dogs should be groomed every four to six weeks to ensure their hair does not get matted and isn't harboring insects or hidden skin conditions. Of course, certain types of dogs haircuts should be groomed more often than others to maintain their appearance.
