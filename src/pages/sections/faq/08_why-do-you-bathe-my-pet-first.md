In order to get an even hair cut, the hair needs to be clean and dry, so I always bathe the dog as part of grooming. Depending on your pet's breed and style, I may do a "rough cut" first. After the rough cut, your pet is washed, dried and then the haircut is completed. In other cases, I may wash and dry the dog, and then the haircut is completed.
