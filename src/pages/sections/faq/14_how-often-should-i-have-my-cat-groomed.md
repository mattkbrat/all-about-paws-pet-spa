A. It is a good idea to have your cat groomed every 6/8 weeks depending on coat type. Even though cats 'clean' themselves, they should be fully groomed to keep the ears clean and infection free, trim the nails and to remove dead skin and also remove excess hair to stop them from ingesting it to help prevent hairballs.
