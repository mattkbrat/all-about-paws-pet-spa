If possible, please refrain from feeding the pet on the day of grooming. Your pet may get nervous during grooming, and it may cause your dog to get the runs or even throw up. Abstain from feeding your pet before the grooming session. If you do feed your pet, please be sure he has ample time to potty before their appointment.
