Yes, I can groom, bathe, brush, and style my kitty clients. I will work with your cat throughout the grooming process in a relaxed atmosphere designed to minimize stress. I do not sedate cats; very few cats truly do need any sort of sedative in order to be groomed. I handle each cat in such a way that the need for drugs of any kind is rare. If I do think your cat would best be served by receiving sedation, I will refer you to your veterinarian.
